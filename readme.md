[Hurricane Analysis](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/bi-data-analyst/tracks/dsf-python-fundamentals-for-data-science-part-ii/modules/dsf-python-dictionaries/projects/hurricane-analysis)

### Project Goals

You will work to write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.

### Directions
Open the file *"hurricane_analysis.ipynb"* for a walkthrough of the project.
